**Structured Query Language** (SQL) is used to manage data in all relational databases like DB2, Oracle, SQL Server etc. SQL standards are maintained by ISO. While most database products comply with the ISO standard, they also offer additional proprietary features. In this course we will restrict ourselves to feature set offered by Oracle database.
